# Conway-Game-Of-Life-Kotlin
Assignment for school using Kotlin to complete Conway's Game Of Life
 I used this source and updated it:
COMP-4411 - Project #1 Game of Life
https://github.com/gabrielgatu/Conway-Game-of-Life-with-Kotlin/tree/master/src
You’ll notice that model of the program is the same. Some functions were pulled straight in, some were modified, and some were from my first attempt. Essentially, I combined my code with this code to finish my project and get me through the parts I was stuck on. You’ll notice that all my function names however are changed. I do this to help me A) understand the code better by creating errors when changing a name, and B) so that I can read it, know where I am and memorize it easier.
